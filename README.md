#Ivan Burgos- Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hello, I'm Ivan. I have recently graduated with a Masters in Data Science and Analytics from the University of West Florida. Before attaining my Masters, I received a bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences from La Sierra University. Since graduation, I have worked as a high school biology teacher and a dyslexia interventionist while completing my M.S. in Data Science. With a strong foundation in life science, I seek to apply data analytical and data science tools to uncover trends, relationships, and other insights that the data provides.

## Projects 
#### Alien Invasion Game: https://github.com/IBurgos-Analyst/Alien_Invasion_Game 
This project aims to apply the Python techniques I learned from the "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. With the information I learned from the book, I applied Python functions, while-loops, and other programming tools to create a simple game.
